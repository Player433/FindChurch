	<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and had dice in the mirror, if anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought nah, <a href="">forget it</a>, yo home to Bel-Air! I pulled up to the house about seven or eight I yelled to the cabbie yo home, smell you later, looked at my kingdom I was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air</p>
